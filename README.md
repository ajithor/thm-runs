The repo contains walkthroughs of THM rooms, from the LainKusanagi's list.
"Walkthrough" is a strong word. This is more like a run-through.
Unstructured narrations, and commands that were used to solve the room.
Useful if you understand the concept, and wanna look back. So, more like quick-notes.
If you're someone who stubled accross this on the internet, remember that "notes can only help the person that created them".
Create your own, All the best!
